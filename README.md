# Speech-Driven Coding üó£Ô∏è
Create/iterate on code using natural language. An AI-Human collaboration üïµÔ∏èüíª‚ú®.

Built for hands-free, accessible coding via dictation.

## Integrations

### [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com): Automated Puzzle-Solving
Focus on developing solutions instead of logistics & coding minutiae like parsing.

Automates the whole process, so you can dictate everything using the CLI.

Automates:
- Downloading inputs.
- Creating files.
- Running code.
- Submitting answers.

Note: AI should not be used for AOC submissions impacting leaderboards. For more info, see https://adventofcode.com/about.
